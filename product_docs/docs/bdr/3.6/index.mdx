# About BDR 3
**Postgres-BDR (Bi-Directional Replication for PostgreSQL)** is a ground-breaking multi-master replication tool for PostgreSQL databases that has been in full production status since 2014. In the complex environment of replication, the 3rd generation of BDR achieves efficiency and accuracy, ensuring very high availability of all nodes in a geographically distributed cluster.

BDR version 3 (“BDR3”) is built on the pglogical 3 extension and requires it to be installed in order to work. It also requires PostgreSQL 10 or newer.
An overview of BDR3, including its features and their benefits, use cases, and deployment options, is available publicly in the Postgres-BDR white paper.
