# About BDR 3
**Postgres-BDR (Bi-Directional Replication for PostgreSQL)** is a ground-breaking multi-master replication tool for PostgreSQL databases that has been in full production status since 2014. In the complex environment of replication, the **3rd generation of BDR** achieves efficiency and accuracy, ensuring very high availability of all nodes in a geographically distributed cluster.

BDR version 3 (“BDR3”) is built on the pglogical 3 extension and requires it to be installed in order to work. It also requires PostgreSQL 10 or newer.
An overview of BDR3, including its features and their benefits, use cases, and deployment options, is available publicly in the [Postgres-BDR white paper](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/postgres-bdr-2ndquadrant/postgres-bdr-download-white-paper-replication-postgresql).
## Editions
BDR3 comes in two editions, the Standard Edition which works on PostgreSQL 10+ and the Enterprise Edition which requires 2ndQPostgres 11+ to run. The Enterprise Edition provides some additional features that are useful in more advanced usage scenarios. These are listed in detail on the first page of the docs (in pdf this is after the table-of-contents).

The documentation for the latest stable (3.6 LTS) release is available separately for each edition:

* [BDR3.6 Standard Edition](https://documentation.2ndquadrant.com/bdr3/release/latest-3.6/)
